# FACS Data

### Binary decision 1

- `facs_dec1_v1`: 

Data source: [https://github.com/AddisonHowe/mescs-invitro-facs](https://github.com/AddisonHowe/mescs-invitro-facs). \
Copied from `data/training_data/facs_v3/pca/dec1_fitonsubset/transition1_subset_epi_tr_ce_an_pc12`. \
Includes training, validation, and testing split of experimental conditions. \
Cells are labeled, and those involved in the first binary decision are isolated. \
PCA is performed on the combined subset of cells collected at days 2 and 3.5. \
All cells, spanning all timepoints, are projected onto the plane spanned by the first two PCs.


### Binary decision 2

- `facs_dec2_v1`: 

Data source: [https://github.com/AddisonHowe/mescs-invitro-facs](https://github.com/AddisonHowe/mescs-invitro-facs). \
Copied from `data/training_data/facs_v4/pca/dec2_fitonsubset/transition2_subset_ce_pn_m_pc12`. \
Includes training, validation, and testing split of experimental conditions. \
Cells are labeled, and those involved in the second binary decision are isolated. \
PCA is performed on the combined subset of cells collected at days 3 and 5. \
All cells, spanning all timepoints, are projected onto the plane spanned by the first two PCs.
